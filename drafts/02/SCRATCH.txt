"I think I love Laundra," he says out loud to no one. 

He decides to accept Laundra, to put up with her. He was made for love. Matt Lamott loves Laundra. Laundra loves laundry. He has no idea what her last name is but that doesn't matter. He doesn't even care what her first name is. (And Lucius creeps about in the bushes behind Matt's thoughts of love.)

"Last time I saw you, there was a lot that was wrong with you. You know, I just got these in," Leo reaches leans forward and pulls a pamphlet from a small multi-tiered display stand on the counter. Seemingly at random, he grabs one printed on the cover with big bold letters: SUICIDE: Know the Signs. "Lets see," Leo says as he begins to read from the pamphlet. 

* you talked about committing suicide 
* you exhibited erratic changes in your personality 
* you harmed yourself in various ways 
* you used drugs 
* you drank too much 
* you were unable to deal with frustration 
* you were unable to communicate effectively 
* you were fighting all the time, with me, with other hobos, whatever 
* you stole from me 
* you neglected your personal appearance--you were filthy stinky filthy 
* you appeared to be depressed, struggling with a long grief reaction to some loss or discouragement 
* you were inactive and bored 
* you were careless. always having accidents 
* you showed clear signs of bizzare thinking, such as delusions 
* sleep disturbances ... you often would collapse on my doorstep and sleep for hours. I couldn't wake you, and sometimes you would stumble about in a daze as if you were sleepwalking, so yes. Sleep disturbances too. 

Leo stares long and hard into Matt's eyes. His gaze penetrates deep into his soul. 

"And now, there is certainly something different about you. You look better. Happy, almost. and I think *this one*" Leo Reaches forward for another pamphlet -- this time he pulls out *Is Your Teenager Falling in Love?* "is totally suited to your current vibe."  Leo begins to read: 

* You are feeling surges of hope 

* Exaggerating the loved one's actual characteristics -- You keep talking about this clothing cleaning lady in pretty ridiculous terms. 

* Loving your own Ideal Self as reflected back at you from the other person (does that sound like you? I don't know about that one). 

* See the object of love as holding important values, such as kindness and success. 

* Feels attraction - which raises desire or presents a challenge. (why did you say you haven't been drinking? sounds like a challenge to me) 

* Maintains idealization of falling in love, but sees clearer the reality of the other (hmmm ... I don't know about that. maybe you just aren't there yet) 

* Confronts limitations of oneself and partner and survives dissilusionment and disappointment (that sound like you? you finding yourself to be confronted with limitations? you overcoming dissilusionment or disappointment? No ... you don't have what it takes, Matt. Or do you?) 

* Feels compassion (I saw what you did out front, there, Matt Lamont, kissing fake babies and sharing your meager wealth. Something is happening to you) 


* Enjoys attitudes of Hope and Optimism 

* Taken a big step on the path out of distress and toward enrichment 

* Feels less lonely or isolated. 

"Glad to see you with a smile on your face.
