# WASH AND DIE part 2: Dead Sober

## Tug Job Grandma <!-- STATUS: edit 1 -->

Matt Lamott was born to mop. 

He is painting a portrait of life, laughter, love and laundry on the floor of THE CLOTHING CLEANING STORE. Swaying gently from side to side, Matt works his masterpiece, executing precise, magnificent strokes with his long-handled paintbrush.

<!-- A man, shivering in his underwear, turns away from the dryer in which his sodden clothes are tumbling on high, steamy heat to look Matt in the eye. "It's a mop," he says. -->

"I am an artist," Matt whispers.

<!-- "It's a paintbrush," Matt whispers. "I am an artist." -->

<!-- "You are an asshole," the man says, turning back to his clothes. -->
  
He puts the finishing touches on his still life floor painting and pulls a pair of Laundra's panties from his pocket. He mops his sweaty brow and admires all his hard work. The scratched, worn floor shines and smiles back. 

"Tile floor, you are one kinky slut," Matt says with a wink. He gently kisses the handle of his mop.

Matt is alone in the store. Laundra is attending a seminar. A clothing cleaning seminar. 

Matt appreciates his time alone without Laundra, but he also can't wait to see her when she gets back. She's Matt's new drug. 

"I love that kinky slut," he says as he touches his dick with the handle of his mop. 

Matt's daydreaming is cut short by the wall-mounted TV. It abruptly turns on, spitting out a high-pitched fuzz. Matt would like to destroy the television with his mop. Instead, he watches.

On the screen: 

> Laundra's grandma cackles endlessly. Her toothless laugh is hypnotizing. She is old and haunting, her face like a wrinkly linen shirt under a tight, powdery halo of permed purple hair. 

> "TUG JOB GRANDMA tugs the dicks off desperate derelicts to bring you TUG JOB[^b] GRANDMA'S COLD CHUNKY SOUP!" a voice on the TV screams. 

[^b]: Urban Dictionary definition of TUG JOB: A tug occurs when a special bond between two people leads to under-the-table extra curricular activities involving the gentle stroking of the penis using the hands and/or feet.     
*"Honey, I hope that you haven't forgotten that today is two-tug-Tuesday"      
"There's nothing I love better than giving you a tug job with my hands and/or feet on two-tug-Tuesday!"*     

> Grandma upends a dented tin can, pouring greasy, thick, chunky brown slop onto a plate.

> "You're going to love TUG JOB GRANDMA'S COLD CHUNKY SOUP!"

> Grandma slowly dips her broken-twig forefinger into the plate of soup and lifts it toward her mouth. Her hand shakes violently, casting off the slop before she can taste it. She tries again, smearing the soup around the plate with her crooked, gnarly finger, spilling it over the edges and onto the brown checkered tablecloth. Again the slop drips from her finger before she can get it into her mouth. A look of intense frustration comes over her and she presses the palm of her hand down into the plate of cold chunky goop. She giggles and hops up and down in her seat with excitement as she clenches and unclenches her rheumy fist, squeezing the brown slop between her fingers and spilling it generously onto the table. Grandma lifts her hand to her face. She shakes and trembles. The chunky, greasy brown slop splashes back onto the plate, but she licks her shaking palm with her dry, leathery tongue. There is enough soup caught in the folds of flesh and between her fingers for her to get a taste, even though most of the goop dribbles down her chin and spatters her blouse before falling onto the floor.

> Grandma closes her eyes and moans. She moans for a very long time. "DELISH!" she shrieks.

The TV flickers off. The word DELISH rings around inside Matt's head like a pair of wet panties tumbling in a dryer. It slides down his throat<!--  like a pair of panties flushed down the toilet -->. His belly growls. He rubs it slowly, gently, passionately. 

"DELISH!" Matt says to no one. "Where can I buy a can of delicious cold shit-soup?"

Matt is cranky and delirious from not eating all afternoon. He can't figure it out, but he's touched by Tug Job Grandma's harrowing journey to get that cold disgusting goop into the gaping butthole that is her mouth. He appreciates her struggle and her poor oral hygiene. He runs the top of his tongue along the bottom of his chipped tooth. He is filled with all sorts of emotions. He knows the names of some of them.

Matt leans his mop against the wall and heads out to buy dinner. Laundra will be home soon. 

## Laundra's Dreams <!-- STATUS: edit 1 -->

Matt and Laundra sit on a pile of laundry in the middle of THE CLOTHING CLEANING STORE, completely naked, save for the socks on their feet--his are pink, hers are yellow. They shovel carne asada fries into their carnivorous horny mouths. 

Matt and Laundra have been eating carne asada fries every night for the past three weeks. They can't stop this roller coaster ride of deliciousness. They deep throat sloppy fistfuls of greasy French fries, thin marinated beef steak, sleazy green guacamole, hot sticky nacho cheese, dirty refried beans and orgasmic sour cream that splatters all over their euphoric faces. 

"Fill me up, slut." Laundra says. 

"Huh?" Matt crinkles his brow.

"I'm talking to the fries," she clarifies. 

Matt smiles admiringly. He's feeling something that he hasn't felt in he-doesn't-know-how long. He's feeling something more than the upset stomach from night after night of carne asada fries. 

"DELISH!" he shouts with his mouth full of sour cream. Matt doesn't even like sour cream. 

Laundra scolds half-heartedly, "Don't talk with your mouth full, bitch-face."

Another smile from Matt. He can't stop smiling. It's not easy to find a sexy lover who shows her affection through verbal abuse. 

He feels like he might actually have a future. He's been living without a future for so long. Longer than he can remember. He's been living moment-to-moment. Living the life of a shortsighted whore, looking for the next fix and for nothing more. He may--or may not--have put his mouth on a boner. He doesn't want to think about it. He doesn't want to think about it because now, lounging in the laundry with Laundra, he is awake. He is awake for the first time. Each moment is an epiphany. Like coming out of a blackout and not thinking 'oh fuck, what did I do and where am I and do *I* need to clean this up?' but thinking instead 'Oh, here I am! This is wonderful. How did I pull this off? If I had friends, I couldn't wait to tell them about this.' Each moment with her is a new discovery. Each heavy click of the second hand jolts him awake, pulls him out of the nightmare of his miserable past and into this perfect present where the only boner he can taste is his own.

"Oh, here I am!" Matt exclaims, pointing his plastic fork upward. 

With each new experience, Matt wakes up a little more. His little dick gets a little harder and his little day gets a little brighter. It's like he's walking on sunshine when he's actually just stepping over crackhead shit. He doesn't quite remember what it was like to be a child, but he hopes it was something like what he's feeling now, something full of awe and wonder.

Matt has a boner, and he isn't sure if he should stick his dick into Laundra or the carne asada fries. He hasn't had an appetite like this for ages. 

"How're your fries?" Matt asks.

"Better than sex," Laundra shouts with her mouth full. 

Matt chuckles. Laundra chuckles. And then a couple of grandmas chuckle. They stand near the dryers, watching Matt and Laundra. Matt is perturbed. He hadn't noticed them. He was too caught up in carne asada goodness. 

"What are they doing?" Matt asks, pointing at the pair of wrinkly old women. 

"Laundry," Laundra says. 

"Do they watch us fuck?" Matt asks. 

Laundra shrugs her shoulders, eats more fries. 

Matt shrugs his shoulders, eats more fries. 

Matt is happy. He feels he owes her something wonderful. Something more than his hard, ferocious little dick. Matt feels calm and safe and he hopes that he can someday repay Laundra. He doesn't say it out loud, but he would do anything to give her the kind of simple and complete joy that he feels now, with sour cream and carne asada grease dripping down his chin. He wipes his hands on a bra beneath his butt.

<!-- The Bra Beneath His Butt - that's a great title! -->

"I love this place," Matt says.

Laundra mops the greasy cream from Matt's chin with a handful of fries and shoves them into her mouth. "There are better places to wash clothes around here," she says, shrugging her shoulders.

"I don't care about other places," Matt says.

"Respectable people don't come here. They take their clothes up the hill." Laundra drops her fork into the nearly empty carton of carne asada fries. 

"Respectable people don't live down here in Shit City," Matt says. "They live up on Penis Hill and they stay up on Penis Hill. Fuck 'em. Fuck Penis Hill."

"Matt ... you can be so fucking blind. You look around and all you see is shit." Laundra points her fork at Matt. "You're a drunk. An angry drunk. An angry blind drunk, and you're up to your eyeballs in shit. There's more to Shit City than shit. There's nice folks too. You might not see them, but there's nice folks here who'd like a nice place to wash their nice clothes, without having to drag them up the hill to BENT PENIS RAINBOW CLOTHIERS, where it costs twice as much but they can have their clothes de-loused and a crackhead won't sneak in and take a dump in a washer."

"Crackhead shit gets the stains out, Laundra." Matt says. "Don't point your fork at me."

Laundra shoots Matt a look and waves her fork in the air like a magic wand. "I want respectable people with respectable money to come *here.* I want respectable people to walk *down* the hill, to come *here* to give me their respectable money. I want to serve foamy lattes *here*. I want to have a communal milk bath over *there*," she says, pointing her fork at a mysterious paint flaked door marked 'storage closet.'

"What's in *there* now?" Matt asks.

"Detergent." 

Matt's eyes widen with wonder.

> Detergent Malt Liquor: for gentlemen who drink Detergent Malt Liquor.

"I want more, you silly little bitch," Laundra says. "I want a big barrel of wine up *there*." There's an empty wall-mount bracket on the wall, next to the television. "We could wash our clothes in *wine*!"

"*Wine*," Matt repeats without Laundra's enthusiasm.

<!-- Matt already knows about the wine because Laundra tells him this at the end of part one. -->

"Bitch-whore, I could turn this heap of a store into one of the first wine-washing clothing cleaning stores in the country!" 

The wine will stain the clothes," Matt says. "Whores will be parading up and down the streets wearing stained clothes. "

"Bitch-butt, Lucius says the wine *reinforces* the fibers of the fabric," she says. "Clothes will never deteriorate with this advanced wine-washing process. *Wine* is *fine*!" 

Matt throws his fork at the grandmas, rolls over on his back, and stares up at the ceiling as Laundra yammers on. 

"My landlord, Lucius, is the wine warlord, Matthew."

Matt sits up. "Don't ever call me Matthew," he says. "The name's Matt." He lies back down and stares up at the ceiling. 

"Pee-eww, *Matthew.* As I was saying, Lucius is my landlord. He's also a wine warlord. I was late with the rent, and I went over to his residence to fuck my way--I mean talk my way out of it. He heard me out and gave me an extension. He's not just some slumlord, Matty." 

Matt sits up. "Don't ever call me Matty," he says. "The name's Matt." Matt lies back down and stares up at the ceiling.

"Don't be such a fatty, *Matty.* Lucius invited me to see him speak. He says his wine-washing process could revolutionize the clothing cleaning industry. We could be the first officially licensed WINE-WASHING CLOTHING CLEANING STORE on the western seaboard."

"WINE-WASHING CLOTHING CLEANING STORE is too many words," Matt says. "Confucius say, 'Me no like Lucius. Me suspicious.' But my boner really wants to help you, Laundra. I have an auspicious boner."

Laundra smiles. "I appreciate the help, Matt. But Lucius is loaded."

Matt is incredibly sleepy. He's beginning to doze. He feels calm and safe here in the store with Laundra and a belly full of carne asada fries. What is up with this Lucius character? He can't seem to keep his eyes open. He yawns and nods off. 

## Matt and Laundra Eat and Fuck <!-- STATUS: edit 1 -->

In his dream, Matt fucks Laundra doggy style on a bed of carne asada fries. Grandmas stand around the bed chanting and whooping, pumping their fists. Instead of permed purple hair, their heads are capped with creamy coifs of guacamole. Matt reaches out and takes a swipe at one of the grandmas' gooey green pompadours. He licks his finger like an opera singer.

"DELISH!" he shouts in ecstasy. 

As Matt slams his penis into Laundra, Laundra slams a fistful of carne asada fries into her mouth. She moans with delight. 

"Bitch, who's your landlord now?" Matt says. But he wonders if Laundra's feelings for him are as strong as her feelings for carne asada fries. 

"Let's be honest," Laundra grunts at Matt, "No man can compete with a crippling order of carne asada fries." 

Self-doubt clamps down on Matt. It claws at his dehydrated calf and seizes into a painful cramp. Matt dismounts Laundra, moaning and writhing in pain. He curls up in the fetal position and frantically rubs sour cream into the flesh of his leg. 

Laundra smiles and sighs peacefully. She sits up on her knees to attend to Matt. She massages his calf as he cries out. She moves down to his foot and gently tugs his big toe backward. 

Matt groans with immediate and ecstatic relief. "DELISH!" he cries as he squirts himself in the chest with a load of his own sour cream. 

He uncurls and pulls Laundra into a sticky embrace. They kiss and settle comfortably into the greasy bed of carne asada fries, floating high above the stench and depravity of Shit City. Guacamole-crowned grandmas hover like cherubs in the sky nearby.

---

Matt awakes to a sleeping Laundra at his side. He sits up to see if any carne asada fries are left. No such luck. Matt lies back down and stares at the ceiling, letting his mind wander off again. He's parched. He needs a drink. 

Matt quietly gets up. Three grandmas peacefully snore on the floor near the washers. Matt tiptoes toward the dryers. He reaches surreptitiously into a dryer marked with an out-of-order sign and pulls out a bottle of swill. He takes a couple of swigs and swishes the fiery stuff around his mouth while Laundra snores into the pile of laundry. Matt swallows and slips the bottle of swill back into its secret spot. He tiptoes back to the pile of clothes and slides down into the nest of laundry beside Laundra, falling into himself.

Booze always brings the his brain into a semblance of order. No matter how chaotic the screaming orgy of his thoughts may be, a little drink will bring him back down into a circus of comfort. With his booze, he can't ever get hurt and doesn't ever have to try. Life just passes by. His life is so passive. Is it because he doesn't want to live? Is he just waiting to die? Is this all there is? He looks around the CLOTHING CLEANING STORE, scratching idly at his dick. 

"To wash or not to wash?" he whispers. 

Matt has a full load of sopping wet thoughts--wrinkled, crumpled, heavy, soggy, saggy as they tumble like the mangled body of a doped-up tranny whore passed out on the corner. He yawns and sinks a little lower into the laundry, turning toward Laundra so he can sniff her hair as he drifts back to sleep.

"Wash and die," a grandma whispers in the dark. 

<!-- HAHA this is fucking great. -->

---

## Out of Order <!-- STATUS: edit 1 -->

Matt wakes up to the sound of his own voice. He is in the middle of an argument with Laundra. "Bitch, wine *stains* clothes," he says. Oh. This again. 

Laundra frowns. "Bitch, you haven't been listening to anything I've said." She's not wearing any clothes. 

Matt's not wearing any clothes either. Realizing this, he covers his crotch. Matt doesn't remember getting undressed. Across the room, he sees five naked grandmas folding laundry. Five? Yes, five. Eesh. They're like an aggressive cancer.

Laundra's tone irritates him. Or maybe it's the way she's using the word 'bitch' now. It started out so sweet and endearing. It had made him laugh. But now it feels like a congealed bullet of phlegm spat into his face.

"Lucius says we need to let go of our outdated ideas about stains," she says. "We're obsessed with the idea that white is clean. White isn't clean though. It's just a color. Lucius says burgundy is the new white. Isn't that amazing?"

<!-- He's so fucking deep -->

Matt is not amazed. Laundra has been attending more and more clothing cleaning seminars, and Matt is tired of hearing about it. 

"No, bitch," Matt spits. "That is *not* amazing. I like wearing *white* shirts. I don't like wearing wine-stained stupid burgundy shirts."  

"Bitch, please. You like wearing *dirty* shirts." Laundra likes putting emphasis on certain words in her speech. 

"Hey, remember last night? When I accidentally jammed my penis into the side of your leg? *That* was dirty ... and a little painful." Matt scratches his dick. It's raw and sore. Laundra's use of emphasis on certain words in her speech is rubbing off on Matt.

<!-- No more butthole jam?  -->

"Lucius has his own TV show. Did I tell you?"

"My dick hurts."

"He works with struggling business owners and helps them prepare for the coming of the new era."

"Sounds sleazy," Matt says.

"Bitch, he's a genius. If I go through the whole seminar series, he might put me on the show."

"Bitch, you don't need some stupid TV show to change this place. This place is perfect."

"The sign doesn't even work," she says, gesturing to the soft glow of the neon shining through the window.

"He's the landlord, right? Shouldn't he fix that without forcing you to do some stupid TV thing? That sounds like ... what's the word? Embezzlement?" Matt wishes he wouldn't have dropped out of college. 

"Extortion, dummy. Bitch."

"Whatever. You don't need Lucius," Matt says. "You've got me. Why don't you ask me for help? I'd do anything for you."

"Bitch, what are you gonna do for me? You can't help me. Even your hair is sloppy. Lucius has the most amazing flattop," Laundra coos.

"Alright, Laundra!" Matt says. "Enough about stupid fucking Lucius and his stupid fucking flattop. I don't want to hear about it," he says, crossing his arms in front of his chest and turning away from her. He looks instead at the padlocked door of the detergent closet. For gentlemen who drink--

"Aww ... does Baby need a tug-tug?" Laundra reaches toward Matt's crotch, but he pushes her away.

Laundra glares at him. "Flip the switch, bitch," she says. "Your jealousy is a real turn-off." 

And just like that, the machines in the store start to turn off, one by one. 

Matt runs to each machine, his little dick swinging. He bangs on the first. Nothing. 

"Bitch," he yells. 

He bangs on the second. Nothing. 

"Bitch!" 

Laundra slips on some ladybug panties. "Out of order?" 

"Out of order," Matt replies, glancing down at Laundra's panties. "Nice panties." 

"Bitch, do you like my panties?" 

"Bitch, I like your panties. They're nice." Matt raises his eyebrows. 

Laundra looks around and lets out a sigh. "Bitch, this place is a shithole." 

And then the television flickers on.

## Lucius appears on TV <!-- STATUS: edit 1 -->

> Lucius is on his hands and knees in a room full of washers and dryers. On the wall behind him, signs with chipped paint and broken English proclaim business hours and regulations.

> Lucius lowers his face to inspect the gap beneath one of the big steel front-loaders. He turns to the camera with a look of disgust.

> "Smells fucking disgusting down here, like somebody came inside a rat that crawled under here to die. When was the last time you cleaned under here, you filthy yellow tapeworm?" He asks.

> A Chinese woman stands stammering and shamed. "I ... I ... I ..." she says. "Last week." 

> "Bull fucking shit you slimy Green-Banded Broodsac.[^broodsac] Look at this." Lucius lifts the machine off the ground, tilting it back with impossible ease, using one hand. With his other hand, he reaches into the dark gap below the machine and scrapes up a handful of brown fuzzy sludge. "You should be ashamed of yourself," Lucius says.

[^broodsac]: A freaky mind-control parasite that forces snails to wander out onto the highest, most exposed perch they can find, and turns their eye stalks into giant pulsating phalluses that lure birds to come along and eat them up. 'Cause the Broodsac wants to get in the bird's belly. Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGyvlt_b3is), or read more [here](http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Leucochloridium_paradoxum.html)
 
> The woman stands in disgusted shock and embarrassment. 

> Lucius lets the machine drop to the ground with a thundering boom and he gets up and shouts in the woman's face. "A fucking week? Bullshit. You fucking filthy whore. You should be ashamed of yourself!" 

> She tries to explain herself, but he doesn't let her speak.

> "I don't want to hear your excuses, you dirty parasite." He rubs the brown sludge into her face and hair. He rips open her blouse and smears her breasts with the foul slime."

"That's Lucius!?" Matt says. "That's the guy that chipped my tooth! Threw a quarter right in my face! And ... there's something else ... something familiar about him. But I don't think I've seen this show before. Where have I?--" 

Laundra touches her vagina. "Bitch, shut up," she says. 

She gets down on her hands and knees, reaches under one of her front-loaders, and tries to clean the gap down below the machine. Under her breath, she says "Maybe if you weren't drunk all the time you could relax. Quit bitching. Let it go and start telling some new stories."

"What's that?" Matt says, looking on with disgust. 

"I *said*, 'Bitch, help me,'" Laundra says. "Lift this thing up so I can get in under there and clean it out, bitch." 

Matt tries to lift the machine, but he can't do it. It's far too heavy for him.

## Matt gets Jealous and Irritable <!-- STATUS: edit 1 -->

Matt stares at his mop from across the room. He touches his dick. He is alone--save for the gaggle of grandmas--in THE CLOTHING CLEANING STORE. Laundra is at another seminar. The floor isn't that dirty. He'll mop later. He could go for a beer. He should start lifting weights so he can lift these machines up like Lucius did on that show. 

"Drinking problem?" he thinks aloud. Where does Laundra get off telling him *he* has a drinking problem? She's the one obsessed with wine ... wine and Lucius. 

Matt addresses the flock of grandmas folding laundry, "Do I have a drinking problem?" They ignore him. 

"Sheesh." Matt eyes the grandmas to make sure they aren't watching before slowly lifting the lid of an out-of-order washer. He pulls out a can of *DETERGENT Malt Liquor*. He cracks it open and pounds it, sucking it back in a matter of seconds. He walks outside and chucks the empty beer can into the street. He flips off the discarded can before returning inside.

Matt's fine. Just fine. 

The grandmas stare. There are at least a dozen of them now. 

"What the fuck are you old birds looking at?" He waves an arm. "Fold those rags." Matt turns his back on the grandmas and stares out the storefront windows.

Laundra's the one who's been irritable. As if it weren't frustrating enough that he has to fight his way through the feathery flock of freaky grandmas that have been quickly multiplying, Matt also has to deal with Laundra criticizing him for having dirt underneath his fingernails, for having a hole in his sock, for having a chipped tooth. 

Matt turns around to shout at the grandmas, "I will spray you with bullets!"

The other day, he had to evict a family of grandmas who were nesting in the rafters. He stood on top of one of the triple-load washers and waved his mop around to shoo them away. They took off with a noisy clapping sound and Matt destroyed their flimsy stick-and-debris nests, smashing them to pieces with his mop.  

Matt observes the bony-bodied grandmas work their gizzards as they do their laundry. They are too busy to notice him. He wonders what would happen if he threw a handful of seed on the floor. The grandmas make soft murmuring sounds as they fold and wash. 

One of the grandmas coughs up and spits out a large glob of phlegm into her yellowed negligee. Using her two thumbs, she massages the phlegm into the threadbare fabric. 

"Get those stains out, you wretched old bird-slut," Matt yells to no effect. "You make me fucking sick and maybe a teeny tiny bit horny but only in a curious, empty, lonely sort of way." He's amazed at how many of them can fit inside the store. They are nasty and impolite, and they are all identical. Matt can't tell them apart. 

Matt fantasizes about beating a few of them with a hammer. They'd squeal and flap their liver-spotted arms. Is this what murderers think about? 

Matt touches his dick. 

A flash of lightning outside followed by the sound of thunder distracts Matt's mental slide into perversion. He turns to the front of the store and watches the gooey shit-rain drip down the storefront windows. 

Matt thinks about Laundra again, and gooey shit-rain seeps into his head. Matt thinks about Lucius. Lucius sounds lecherous. 

Fucking Lucius. Fucking Laundra. Lucius Fucking Laundra.

Matt scowls at his reflection in the shit-streaked glass.

He bares his freshly brushed yellow teeth[^teeth] and stares at the chip in his front tooth. His gums are raw and bleeding from not having been brushed in quite some time. 

[^teeth]: Here's a great inexpensive way to make your teeth look whiter: replace your bright white light bulbs with dimmer, yellower light bulbs.

Fucking Lucius. 

In is head, Matt plays a loop in which the orange-skinned man in white with the really nice flattop throws a quarter at his face. Over and over, the shining disk comes spinning through the air straight as a saucer and smashes into Matt's mouth. The pain comes searing through the broken-record memory and tingles into Matt's jaw and down his spine and his already sour mood spoils further. 

"Unfriendly flattop freckled freak faggot fuck," Matt seethes. Those are all the F words he knows. 

<!-- nice! -->

Matt has seen men hit on Laundra. He has seen Laundra's own grandmas hit on her. Matt considers murdering Lucius. Why not murder all men? He considers murdering the grandmas doing laundry too. With a hammer. He wonders where he could find a hammer. He could swing his mop like a hammer. His impotent rage boils. 

Matt grabs his mop. He'll fucking mop the fucking floor even though it's still pretty clean. Fuck it. He'll make the fucker shine. He'll mop the floor until it bleeds.

And so he mops. 

And he mops. 

And the floor shines. 

And then a scruffy grandma in a mangy fur coat enters the store, dragging a soggy bag of dirty laundry across the clean floor. She leaves the door open, allowing a surge of wind to push through, bringing with it sour rain and squishy garbage. A scuzzy pair of granny panties falls out from her laundry bag onto the floor. 
	  
"Excuse me," Matt Lamott says to the passing grandma. 
	  
The raggedy-ass grandma turns, flips Matt off with her flea-bitten middle finger and continues toward the wall that is lined with dryers from floor to ceiling. 

A tremendous flash of lightning from the raging storm outside rattles the storefront windows. The sky is a mass of black cloud. Matt closes the door. 
	  
"Please keep the door closed!" he yells. 
	  
All of the scaly grandmas turn in unison to flip Matt off before returning to their chores. 
	  
"You tatty, moth-eaten cunts!" Matt yells.

He stares at the shit-stains on the pair of granny panties on the floor. The panties are red with black polka dots, like a ladybug. He spits on them. 

Matt licks his chipped tooth. He snaps. He swings his mop like a great long-handled hammer and strikes a grandma in the face. She falls down, stunned. The other grandmas go about their laundry business, paying no mind to the violent occurrence. 

Matt immediately regrets his actions. With shaking hands, he picks up his mop and the grandma. She starts folding her clothes as if nothing happened. 

Matt looks out the storefront windows. A fierce bolt of lightning flashes and strikes a homeless person dead in the street. The windows rattle, shaking Matt's thoughts. 


## Matt struggling with depression <!-- STATUS: edit 1 -->

Matt stares at the floor. There's a streak of carne asada grease from all the fucking that he hasn't been able to mop away.

He feels uneasy. Untrusting. Untrustworthy. Lightheaded.

He attacks the grease with his mop. He slops grey soapy water down from out of the bucket and drives it back and forth over the streak as he tries to dissolve it.

Matt is sweaty. He's out of breath. 

Matt moves a few armfuls of clothes from a wheeled basket into a range of dryers. Clothes from the lovemaking nest he shared with Laundra. 

<!-- I don't know about this shit here -->

He takes some quarters from the coffee tin--"Don't ever take any of these quarters out of the store," Laundra had told him. "They're for washing clothes only."

He knocks quarters into slots and presses buttons and sets things to tumbling.

He feels light-headed and sweaty and out of breath. Such a simple task shouldn't leave him so fatigued. A life of drunken debauchery has taken its toll on Matt's health.

Matt reaches into a washer that is out of order and pulls out a half-finished forty of DETERGENT malt liquor. He takes a swig to calm his nerves. 

As the mopwater dries on the floor, the streaks of grease return.

Watching the clothes tumble around inside the dryers, he realizes that he never washed them.

"Fuck it," Matt mumbles, taking another swig.

Matt doesn't trust Laundra. He doesn't trust anyone. He doesn't trust himself. He leans against the washing machine, listening to the hum of the dryers, listening to his heart.

It's late at night. Where is she? Matt wishes he could fall asleep. But he can't with all these thoughts and feelings tumbling around in his head.

Matt spots a pair of dirty red panties with black polka dots in one of the dryers and watches them spin round and round. 

"There is no love," Matt barks. "Only business. The laundry business. The business of washing clothes. The business of fucking!" 

No one responds. No one hears him, for it is late and he is alone in the CLOTHING CLEANING STORE.

Matt takes a hard, long swig.

"I've thrown my life into the wash. And for what? Trust has to be washed and dried on the delicate cycle. But my trust has been frayed, you pieces of shit! All of you are pieces of shit! I'm a piece of shit!

"My trust has been frayed by life. Maybe it's my own fault. Maybe I washed my delicate trust with the whites and ruined the whole load of clothes that is my pathetic life. Maybe my trust never had a chance."

Matt is gasping for air. He takes another swig. He sits down on the dirty linoleum floor. It's filthy. All his mopping has been for nothing. He feels sorry for himself. Too sorry to get back up. Too sorry to mop the floor or wash the clothes. The sweat has dried on his body, leaving a thin filmy glaze on his skin. He feels dirty.

Laundra does care about him. She has said so. But Laundra probably will fuck Lucius. Maybe she already has. Matt should focus on the love, on the long term. But he just can't let this go. He grips his forty close to his heart.

There's no point in cleaning clothes. Clothes were made to be dirty. Life is dirty. Matt is dirty.

He gets up and turns the dryers off. He pulls the clothes out and tosses them onto the floor. He pours the rest of his forty out onto clothes.

Matt is crying. "Fuck you," he shouts, flipping the laundry off. "Fuck you, laundry!" Matt sniffles. "Dirty fucking clothes! Damn it all to hell!"

Life be damned. Love be damned. Laundry be damned. Laundra be damned. Lucius be damned. Everything be damned. Damned, damned, damned.

The only way to be honest and clean is to be homeless and filthy like the rest of the flea-ridden vagrant scum living on the streets, sucking on the shit-caked sidewalks. Matt wasn't made of durable material. He has always known this. It's why he has always run away. Retarded riff-raff on the run.

Matt reaches into the 'clothes washing only' coffee tin and pulls out a handful of quarters. Enough for a few forties.

It's so much easier to give up, to leave the pile of laundry on the floor. No one likes doing laundry. It's one of the top ten worst things in this world.

Just as Matt is ready to leave the store, Laundra waltzes in with an order of carne asada fries and a smile on her beautiful face. The gaggle of grandmas waddles in behind her. They pick up the laundry off the floor and place it in the washers, busying themselves once again with laundry.

"Matt, you look terrible." Laundra sets the carne asada fries on top of a washer. "What's wrong?" She touches Matt's shoulder.

Matt drops the quarters onto the floor and wants to die.

"Matt," Laundra says, her voice gleaming with concern. "Where's your shoes?"

## UGG Boots - Do You Believe in Love? <!-- STATUS: edit 1 -->

What happened to Matt's last pair of shoes? He can't quite remember. A shot of whiskey would help.

He once traded a pair of shoes for a bottle of whiskey. The arches were too high and with each step he took, they chopped into his feet like a hermit with a hatchet chopping up petrified crackhead shit.

It looked like somebody tried to chop up Sally with a hatchet. Sally in the Alley. The whore corpse from the other day. Matt's mind keeps turning back to her. Was he wearing shoes when he found her? She had big feet. Was she wearing shoes? 

Matt is disoriented and crying and short of breath. He's been running. His eyes sting with sweat and acid rain. The smell of wet garbage sticks to the roof of his mouth. 

"Sally?" he calls. Matt is convinced the state of his feet is directly correlated to the state of his mind. The shoe represents sanity. "Sally? Have you seen my shoes?"

A cramp in the arch of his left foot calls to him with the faint cry of a distant foghorn, or a vagrant wailing to the moon.  

He stretches the foot until the cramp recedes. It's as if the cramp was threatening him. Matt sighs.

This looks like the place. 

"Sally?" Matt calls again. He starts riffling desperately through a giant pile of garbage. "Where are you, Sally? Why does Laundra put her clothing cleaning store above our love?"

Sally knows about things like this, Matt thinks. She knows so much about love it's killed her. She's lucky enough to have had a love so strong it killed her with a hatchet.

<!-- TODO: revisit the SALLY scene in part one -->

"She's addicted or something," Matt continues. "She cleans clothes even when they don't need cleaning. There's a washer running in her heart and a dryer in her mind."

<!-- A description of Sally. She's in worse shape than last time: Matt pulls away more trash to reveal the remains of a dead hooker along with rotten vegetables and other cooking waste. Her upper lip is covered in what looks like Parmesan cheese. Her remains resemble roast beef and smell like beef stroganoff. -->

Matt pulls away more trash to reveal Sally's dead hooker face framed in rotten vegetables and other cooking waste. 

"No, Sally. I'm the weak one. I'm the damaged one. I never learned how to trust. Laundra's the strong one."

Sally's upper lip is covered in what looks like Parmesan cheese. Her remains resemble roast beef and smell like beef stroganoff.

"Well ... now that you say it, it does seem like she is afraid to love. I maybe give myself over too much, but she doesn't give herself over at all. Almost as if she doesn't believe in love. Ha-ha, Sally. Don't say that. No. Say it again. Ha-ha. That *is* all she cares about, isn't it? That run-down shack of a shit-store. Right? No! ... Do you think I should? You think I could? Shit in one of her washing machines? Hahaha you are *terrible,* Sally. Terrible." 

Matt makes a mental note to take a shit in one of Laundra's washing machines. 

"You'd do that for me?" he says. "You'd give me the shoes off your feet, wouldn't you? Well, thanks, Sally. I knew there was something wonderful about you, the moment I saw your beautiful bloated face pressed down into the gutter, half-covered with garbage. Hey--What size shoe do you wear? And where are your legs? Has something been eating you?"

He flings chunk after sack of garbage over his shoulder, searching for her lower appendages, singing softly to himself "Sally in the Alley."

Matt flings off a bit of garbage to reveal a pair of UGG boots that shine like a pot of glimmering gold.

"Eureka!"

Matt steps backward onto a pile of human feces sprinkled with shards of glass from a broken crack pipe.

"Yelp!"

Matt lets out a yelp. He stumbles back across the alley and falls onto a discarded sofa sitting on the narrow sidewalk against a building. The sofa is stained with human feces. He wipes at the shit on his foot. He picks out the bits of glass from his flesh. He curses the shredded sky and its menacing fecal clouds.

The sofa that Matt sits on is infested with bed bugs. He scratches at his arms and stands back up. These bed bugs are now Matt's bed buds.

Matt grabs an UGG boot and tugs but it won't give. Matt scratches his head. He scratches his arms and legs. He scratches the back of his neck. Matt flings off more garbage, revealing Sally's legs.

Her legs are shaved and severed. They're shredded like mauled celery: UGGs on one end, shredded mozzarella cheese on the other, just above the knees.

<!-- Matt pulls away more trash to reveal the remains of a dead hooker along with rotten vegetables and other cooking waste. Her upper lip is covered in what looks like Parmesan cheese. Her remains resemble roast beef and smell like beef stroganoff. -->

Matt wonders what it would be like to have sex with a dead hooker covered in mozzarella cheese. His mind quickly turns to Laundra. She has given up on love and the human race.

Matt kicks at Sally's feet, trying to loosen the boots so he can slip them from her shredded shanks.

"Do you believe in love?" Matt asks.

Matt scratches his head and shoulders. He scratches his arms and legs then scratches his dick. He scratches his negative thoughts about Laundra and focuses back on the trash at hand.

<!-- Matt is careful not to remove the garbage covering the dead hooker's face.  -->

The smell of rotten pussy is pungent. 

Matt struggles with the boots, pinning down Sally's calves with his knee while he tugs at the UGGs until they finally slip free. 

He knocks over a box containing a bloody heart that rolls out onto the alley street.

The heart twitches like a small rodent curled up in a ball trying to sleep through a cold night. Matt's eyes must be playing tricks on him. He drops the UGG boots then rubs at his eyes with his hands, completely oblivious to the bed bugs crawling all over the UGGs and his body.

Matt can't tell if the heart is human or animal. It squirms and Matt feels a pain in his chest. He grimaces. The pain ebbs, leaving a halo of pain in his chest that slowly subsides like a ring of smoke vanishing into the dead air.

Then, without warning, a freight train of pain hits Matt and he doubles over, falling to his knees. The heart on the street flops like a fish out of water on the alley street. He grasps for air. Again, the pain slowly subsides.

"Sally? Is that yours? Do girls have hearts?" Maybe it's a pig heart. Matt lurches forward to pick it up. Just as he is about to touch it with the tips of his fingers, it twitches and focuses a big milky eye on Matt. It is not a heart at all. It is a greasy slimy rat. The rat unfurls, bites Matt on the finger and scurries into the garbage.

Matt sucks on the bite, takes some time to collect himself. He picks some shards of glass off his own bloody feet, puts the UGGs and turns away. "Thanks, Sally. You've got a rat for a heart, but you are real nice."

The UGGs are comfortable but they make Matt's feet sweat. It feels like he's walking on clouds about to burst with hot rain. He closes his eyes and imagines he is in heaven—a heaven full of naked hookers—naked hookers and Laundra, of course. But lots of naked hookers too...

God is probably a naked hooker in high heels wistfully blowing angels with soft and sweet winged dicks up in the heavenly clouds of cum and melted mozzarella cheese. 

Clouds are just cum puffs.

Cum billows out the winged dicks of horny haloed angels like wisps of smoke jetting into the air. Shooting stars are actually stripper poles up in heaven. Chew on that, scientists. You goddamn Satanists! 

"Sweet shoes," a vagrant with no arms stumbling along the sidewalk mutters as Matt strolls by.

Matt smiles. He holds his head up high. This is footwear for royalty. The UGG boot. Matt feels good. Maybe the UGG boot will fill the void in his heart.

The armless vagrant waves his stubs at Matt. "Spare some change?"

Matt continues on, ignoring the incomplete homeless person.

"You don't have a heart!" The armless bum yells.

Matt thinks about his heart as he walks. "You don't have any arms," he yells back.

His feet are burning up but he doesn't care. "I feel lighter on my feet," Matt says aloud to no one in particular.

In the distance, Matt spots an incredibly attractive woman scantily clad in a tight dress and high heels, smoking a cigarette and looking fresh on the corner of the street. The way she pops and moves with her curves and verve lures Matt closer.

But as Matt nears, the street goddess transforms and slips through his fingers like powdered laundry detergent. The physical woman of his dreams turns out to be a shape-shifter! Matt traces the angular line of her jaw along with the five o'clock shadow resembling Velcro. Her breasts are indeed popping out of her tight dress and her ass is like a lovely little love balloon. But this beauty is a man.

Matt's shoulders drop. He should know by now that every woman flaunting it is just another two-bit tranny hooker wanting it—trying to earn that cash sucking cock in order to smoke that rock. Matt thinks about Laundra. He wonders if their love can stand the stress of this city.

"You lookin' good, Doll," the tranny whispers in a deep sultry voice as Matt passes.

## Laundra talks to Matt about his Drinking <!-- STATUS: edit 1 -->

Matt is tired and irritable. He feels used. Laundra is never around. She puts Matt to work and takes off for her seminars. She doesn't care about him. She treats him like a piece of meat, fucks him whenever she wants and then just turns around and leaves. 

That asshole Lucius is a sleazy man-whore. He'd fuck anything. Everything. Laundra wouldn't fuck him, would she? He's probably touching her right now. Using her as an example in his stupid fucking wine washing presentation. 

Matt leans his mop against the bank of machines and reaches into a large dryer with an 'out of order' sign taped to the glass. He looks around, casually giving all the grandmas a once-over. No one is watching. He pulls out a 40 oz.[^40] bottle of *Detergent Malt Liquor for Men* and twists off the top. It's lukewarm. Matt doesn't care. He drinks a long draught of the precious golden fluid, trying in vain to slake his bottomless thirst.

[^40]: 1182.94 ml

Matt can picture it: Lucius calls Laundra to the stage at the front of the packed auditorium. They're standing next to a monstrous contraption--a wine barrel with levers and portholes and hoses and cables--Lucius puts his hand on Laundra's shoulder and leans in close, starts whispering in her ear.

Matt takes another long pull of the beer and takes a few steps down the aisle.

Lucius is telling Laundra to take off her panties and put them into the wine barrel. His hand caresses her shoulder before sliding down her back.

Matt shakes his head, trying to clear the vision from his mind's eye, but it does no good. 

Laundra does as she is told. She slides her lady bug panties out from under her skirt and lets them fall to the ground around her ankles. She steps free but catches the panties on the heel of one of her black pumps and kicks them up into her hand. She holds them out to Lucius. 

He takes them in his massive orange salon-tanned paw and presses them to his face. He inhales deeply and his eyes roll back into his head. "Observe," he says as he holds the panties up in both hands for the audience to see. He pulls them apart and quite easily makes a small tear in the fabric. "The fabric, in it's natural state, is *weak*." He opens a porthole in the wine barrel contraption and flings the panties inside. "Now, we wait," he says. "In a few minutes, I'll demonstrate the awesome structural reinforcing power of my patented wine-washing process."

"How long will it take?" asks Laundra.

"Just long enough," says Lucius. He pushes her face-down onto a bed of silk sheets, lifts her skirt up over her hips and begins to cover the back of her thighs with his saliva.

The strand of bells hanging by the front door of THE CLOTHING CLEANING STORE jingles, drawing Matt out of himself. He quickly caps his 40 and slips it into the nearest machine, not noticing that it is running. The bottle thuds and clangs inside the machine as it turns. 

Matt calls out, "Laundra. I was just thinking about you. I wasn't expecting you ..."

He wasn't expecting her to return so soon. They haven't been communicating so well so maybe he missed something, but he thought she'd be at the seminar for the rest of the day.

"I left early," Laundra says. "I was thinking about you too. About us. I know it hasn't been easy around here, but--"

"Look," Matt says. "I've never really felt like this before. I ... that is ... I can't remember the last--" Matt interrupts himself with a mighty bellowing belch that seems to shake his balance. His eyes cross and uncross.

"Are you drunk?" Laundra asks.

"What, bitch?" Matt burps again.

The sound of glass exploding followed by a terrible hissing and boiling plus the sound of metal grinding into metal and fabric tearing and the hiss of steam and a loud clang followed by a louder CLANG and then the smell of cooking beer smashes their conversation to bits before it can get started.

<!-- LOL -->

"What the fuck was that?" Laundra says, shoving Matt out of her way as she stalks over to the dryer. "It stinks like a brewery." She opens what remains of the dryer door and pulls out the broken pieces of Matt's 40. She stares at the label. "*Detergent Malt Liquor for Men*" she says. "Goddamn it, Matt. Do you know how much this is going to cost me?"

"I'll ... pay for ..." Matt says. "I can make it better."

"Bitch," Laundra says. "You can't make it better. I can't keep doing this. I came back here to apologize to you. I want to take this relationship further. Don't you?"

Matt does.

"You've got to straighten out, bitch." Laundra slaps Matt." Take care of yourself. Take care of my grandmas. If you are serious about this. If you want to make this work. You and me. This place. If you want to work here, and fuck me, you can't be destroying my shit. You have got to lay off the booze. Stop drinking, Matt. Or it's over between us."

"Okay! I can do it!" Matt says. "I'm sorry I broke the machine. It's really only a funny accident, if you think about it. Detergent? I put detergent in with the clothes." 

Laundra weeps. Matt puts his arm around her. 

"I'll start cleaning myself up by getting a haircut," Matt says, thinking of Lucius.

<!-- Nice fucking work -->

## Matt gets a Haircut and some News <!-- STATUS: edit 1 -->

"BARBER SHOP!" Matt yells as he opens the door to the barber shop. It smells of decomposing flesh. A smoke machine is throbbing and puffing out smoke. Matt can't see anything. Matt coughs. 

"Hello?" 

The smoke machine sputters to a stop. Matt waves the smoke away from his face. An obese man appears as if from a dream. An immediate wave of revulsion passes over Matt.

"I cut your hair," the obese barber says, smoke billowing out from his mouth. Sweat beads on his face and neck. His matted hair is damp.

"Flattop," Matt says. 

"I give you haircut." The obese barber motions for Matt to sit in the barber chair. 

Matt sits. "I want a flattop," he says. 

The barber snaps his scissors. "I give you bowl cut," he says, struggling with the words as they modulate into a phlegmy coughing fit.

"I don't want a bowl cut. I want a flattop," Matt snaps. 

The barber drapes a cloth over Matt, attaching it at his neck. For a split second, the barber puts his hands around Matt's throat. He quickly releases his grip. 

"Okay, I give you flattop," the barber gurgles, swallowing the last results of his violent expectoration. 

"I want a flattop," Matt repeats. 

The barber lowers his face down to Matt's and repeats, quite loudly and insistently now, "I give you flattop." He spins Matt around in the chair. "I cut the fuck out of you." 

Matt feels uncomfortable. He stares at the television set mounted on the wall as the barber goes to work. 

> An obese man with blonde eyebrows and a brunette toupee dances about in a billowy wedding dress, singing in an obscene falsetto:

> "All of me ... why not take all of me?"

> Dense paragraphs of text scroll by the screen almost too fast for the eye to follow. The screen flickers. The rolling text slows, reverses and scrolls back the other way, as if someone is adjusting the V-hold. The obese male bride dances and hops and flutters without breaking his song. 

> The on screen text reads: 

>> SPARKY LAMOTT, 76, respected husband, hotelier and family man, died on Friday in the famous Cliffside Grotto Pool at his very own *Fontis Hotel,* after a rupture in the connective tissues of the hotspring structure tore his body to pieces while he was bathing with his wife. according to a report by the medical examiner, Lamott died of "natural causes."  

>> Sparky is survived by his lovely wife Lala, 19, and his son Matthew, 35.

"Don't ever call me Matthew," Matt says. "The name's Matt." He leans forward. "I'm 35?"

>> We (the people) hereby issue a GENERAL SUMMONS for one Matthew Lamott to report to the family property for a meeting with the executor of the estate to discuss matters Post-Mortem and Fiduciary. There is a GREAT INHERITANCE at stake here. Report immediately to the primary location of the estate in question, *the Fontis Hotel,* to procede with the EXECUTION of the WILL and the delivery of GREAT INHERITANCE.

Matt leans back. "I hate it when people call me Matthew," he says to the barber. "Do I look 35 to you?"

"35 dollar. Nice price for nice hair, yes," the barber chortles. The jiggling wet fat of his underarms slops across Matt's shoulder.

"What? No! The sign says nine. I give you nine dollar."

"No 35?"

"No. 35 years old. 35 old? Does that sound right? Is that possible? Do you understand me?"

"Oh yes. How old? No more than 57." The barber chuckles and expectorating chuckle. "Matty."

"My name is Matt," Matt says, leaning forward.

The song playing on the television draws to a close and is replaced by the rich husky voice of an announcer.

> "Come on Down, Matthew Lammot. While the Network is compassionate, and Sorry for your Loss, we are also very pleased to present you with your GREAT INHERITANCE. So Come on Down to the Fontis Hotel and make your claim!"

"Ooo ... your daddy dead, Matty. You no move head," the barber says, pushing Matt back into his chair. Sweat dripps from the barber's lumpy, bulbous nose and splashes down into Matt's half-formed flattop. Matt can see the sweat drop in the mirror, he feels it smack his freshly exposed scalp.

"My name is Matt!" Matt shouts. "Now make my top Flat!"

The sweat drips from the barber's nose and he says "You like flattop?"

"I've been estranged from my father for so long," Matt says. "This has potential to be an emotionally impactful moment, but I'm so out of touch with myself that I feel nothing but emptiness. Laundra was right. Thank goodness I've decided to become sober and take responsibility for my own life and circumstance. Otherwise I might've missed this opportunity entirely. Perhaps the first step toward a fulfilling emotional life is the ability to recognize the absence of my own feelings."

"You shut up now. You like flattop." The Barber shields Matt's face with an outdated copy of NINJAS WITH BOOBS as he sprays product into Matt's hair, sculpting the fibers into a chunky, uneven mockery of a flattop.

Matt stands up. "Goddamn, I could really do something with all that money! My dad was quite wealthy, you know; the Fontis, an institution. I could rebuild Laundra's clothing store. She'll never have to talk to that dick Lucius again. All I need to do is to claim my rightful inheritance. To claim my inheritance, I must face my own past and return to the *Fontis Hotel*, the property in which I was raised up by my family, all of whom are now dead, for my father was the last living relative beknownst to me ..."

The barber hands Matt a piece of paper with a phone number on it. He caresses Matt's ear with the index finger of his left hand while he jams a horsehair brush into Matt's face with his right hand and he coos like he's just crossed over the threshold into the third act of some auto-erotic adventure--he's just past the point of no return when he's overtaken by a coughing fit of epileptic proportions, and he hacks and sputters and folds in half, resting his hands on his knees while he tries to catch his breath and he wheezes out the words "Call me," to Matt, waving to him with the horsehair brush as Matt walks out the door and into the drizzling rain, his poorly-planed flattop sparkling in the wet neon glow of Shit City.

## Matt tries to convince Laundra that she needs him. <!-- STATUS: edit 1 -->

Back at THE CLOTHING CLEANING STORE ...

"Your dad owns the Fontis Hotel?" Laundra asks, incredulous. "I thought you were just a filthy hobo." She mops the floor half-heartedly.

"I thought I was too," Matt says, touching his flattop. "But look at me now. Check out my flattop."

Laundra grimaces. 

"We're going to be rich, Laundra." Matt says. And then a wave of regret flashes over his face. "I just wish ..."

"You never got the chance to say goodbye to your father, did you?" Laundra hands Matt the mop. 

"No. I didn't, but that's not it. I don't feel anything. It's weird. I should feel *something,* shouldn't I? I should want to drink, getting news like that. And I guess I do. But ... since we talked the other day ... you know, I'm trying not to drink. And I don't even know if I want to. I don't know if ... I just ..." Matt hands the mop back to Laundra.

"So you don't feel anything. So what? Take this time to do what you need to do. You probably are feeling something, down deep. And sooner or later, that feeling will rise up and swallow you whole. But now, if you're not feeling anything ... get to work. Take care of your business while you still can." Laundra hands the mop back to Matt. "Here, take this."

Matt takes the mop. "Not just nothing. I feel empty. So empty that ... I feel so much of nothing that it's a lot. Do you know what I mean? It's like a really really intense nothing. I don't know. Maybe this *is* feeling, and I've just never felt before. Is this what it means to be alive? To be sober? I don't think I like it. But maybe I can do something about it." Matt hands the mop back to Laundra.

"That's what I've been trying to tell you, Matt," Laundra says, pushing the mop back into his hands. "*Do* something about it."

"Look, baby bitch. There's a lot of money tied up in that hotel. Now that my dad is dead, I have a GREAT INHERITANCE coming. Do you know what that means? It means I can make your big wet dreams come true. I want to have a future with you. And we can do it. With my daddy's money, we can make this place awesome. I want a future with you, here. Without that dick Lucius. Fuck that prick. You don't need him. You need me. I've got the money now, and the power. I'll make this place into whatever you want. People will come from miles around to wash their clothes here. I love you, bitch. You don't need Lucius. You need me." Matt thrusts the mop back at Laundra. "I don't feel like mopping."

"I don't need you, bitch. I want a future with you, But you don't have to provide for me. I don't expect--and I don't want--some kind of chauvinistic rescue. If I wanted something like that, I wouldn't have wasted my time on you. I'd be chasing someone who really *has* money. Someone like Lucius." 

"That's right, you don't need him anymore," Matt says, stepping away from Laundra.

Laundra shrugs. "Are you hearing me right? I think it's really sweet that you want to try and take care of me. But seriously, this is my life. I can handle myself. I'm more worried about you, Matt. I've been working hard, cleaning you up, helping you get your shit together. You'd still be drunk in the gutter with shit all over your feet if it wasn't for me. It's *my* job to clean *you* up. That's what I do. The name's Laundra." 

Matt waves. "Nice to meet you."

"I love taking dirty things and making them clean. Look at you, Matt. You're my beautiful bitch. We are going to be fine. And we don't need your hotel money, if it even exists. I'm going to be on Lucius' RETAIL RENOVATION GANGBANG. I'm going to make this place beautiful, Matt." Laundra leans the mop against Matt.

Matt takes the mop. "That's right! Fuck Lucius and his RETAIL RENOVATION GANGBANG! I've got the money. I'm not just some worthless hobo. I'm a ..." he trails off. 

"Matt," she says. "We've got a future together. We can do this. But I'm not stupid. If you came at me with a pile of money, I'd be a fool to turn you down just because I like you." She looks into Matt's eyes for a long time and he doesn't say anything. "Look, I'm going to do what I need to do. And right now, you need to do what you need to do. I'm going to make this place awesome. I'm going to make my big wet dreams come true. And I'm going to dress you up all nice and cute and take you along with me. You are right. Lucius is a sleaze. But so what? You think I'm going to fall in love with him just 'cause he foots the bill for cleaning this place up?"  

"I'm afraid your going to fuck him." Matt hands the mop back to Laundra.

"Oh, Matt ..." Laundra takes the mop with one hand and with the other licks her thumb and reaches out to wipe a smudge of something from Matt's face. "You worry too much."

"So ... you're not going to fuck him? You won't go on the show?"

"That's not what I'm saying, Matt. I am getting the feeling you only hear what you want to hear." 

Matt takes the mop from Laundra. "I feel so much better," he says. "Thanks." He whistles while he mops.

## dressed up and falling down <!-- STATUS: edit 1 -->

Matt's cleaned up.

Laundra's grandmothers stamp around in the back room, making a terrible racket. They come out in a line, each carrying a plastic hamper with a sheet of paper taped to the side. Each of the sheets of paper has the words 'Lost and Found' written in large block letters, black and precise, hand drawn with a huge marker.

They surround him in a circle and reach deep into the baskets, pulling out strange abandoned garments and tossing them up into the air.

The garments shoot straight up to the ceiling, which seems higher than Matt remembers. They reach the top and unfurl like parachutes. They unfurl their wings like great birds that are heavy and awkward on earth, but in the open skies are elegant creatures of grace and fluid motion. They circle soar doesil around the store and slow, swirling impossibly slow until they change direction and turn widdershins. The air fills with flying fabrics. Faux Fendi suits spread their arms and flap about like frustrated falcons. Fancy underthings with lace like fine filigree fall gently to the floor, floating like feathers.

It is overwhelming. Matt submits to a powerful vertigo and the ground seems to drop away beneath him. His arms are one hundred miles long. His legs dissolve into nothingness. A shirt hits him in the face and blocks out his vision. He can feel a barrage of various articles of clothing slapping up against him. They cover him. They weigh him down. He feels the ground beneath him. The clothes press him down into the floor. They squeeze the air out of his lungs. He tries to move his hands to pull the veil from his eyes, but he is pinned. The smell of starch fills his nostrils and he wants to cry out but ...

Laundra is pressing a damp cloth to his forehead. "You alright? You gave us a little scare."

Matt is fine. He is dressed in the finest clothes he can remember. His glorious UGG boots. A mismatched suit. A blazer and some slacks and a yellow button down with a lichen green tie with a tiny windswept cypress tree embroidered into it. Windswept.

"Thanks for the clothes, Grandma," Matt says on his way out the door.

The crowd of grandmas turn their heads in unison and in unison give him the finger.

## Matt is Sober, pays old debts <!-- STATUS: edit 1 -->

Matt walks down the street feeling cleaner. His leg cramps are gone. He doesn't exactly enjoy being sober, but he doesn't exactly hate it, either. He has a place, a person, a space, a race, a face to work for, a thing to fuck that is more than just a thing to fuck. For the first time in a long time, he feels something about something instead of bleak emptiness and the desire to put his balls on things. 

Outside LORD'S LIQUORS, a pale skinny man in a floral print dress rocks a stroller back and forth with his toe while taking Olympic swimmer breath size hits from a crackpipe. 

Matt reaches into the stroller and picks up a freakish doll. He kisses it on the forehead. He puts the doll back into the stroller. 

The guy in the dress sucks on his glass pipe like he might be able to pull God through it and into the world of the living. 

Matt tosses some quarters into the stroller. "Nice dress," he says. The guy claps his hands together and the pipe vanishes. Matt blinks. "Where'd it?--"

The guy puts his hand on Matt's shoulder and looks deep into his eyes. Clear yellow snot is dripping from his nose onto his lips. He licks his lips. He looks like he is trying very hard to think of the right way to say something important. He waves one arm up over his head and squeals something about a hernia and an AM radio tuner and a drive-in movie theater. "Did she hagguffa likes zhja picture?!?" he screams. "That's howshe topstit off. BOONG! Likuh ... Likuh Dat! You know? Ah *tried*sa teller."

It kind of hurts Matt's ears, but it also reminds him of one of Laundra's grandmas.

He wishes he never hit that grandma with his mop. Damned if he isn't starting to like those crotchety old bitches. 

"You love someone a lot more once you beat the shit out of them," Matt tells the man in the dress before he turns away and walks into LORD'S LIQUORS. 

Father Leo, the Liquor-Store Priest, quickly tucks the latest copy of NINJAS WITH BOOBS out of sight, hiding it under an issue of VAGINAS IN THE VATICAN when he hears the electronic jingle of the door hymn.

"Where have you been, Matt Lamott?" he asks.

"I've been working," Matt says. 

"You look good," Leo says, eying Matt's UGG boots passionately. "Clean. Like you've been keeping yourself out of the gutter." 

"I'm a new man," Matt smiles. "Hey! What happened to your weird accent?"

"I'm off my meds," Leo says, smiling back.

Matt walks up to the counter and counts out a short stack of quarters. "Two fifty," he says. "For the forty I broke." 

Matt stands there silently for a long while while Father Leo stares into him. 

Leo snaps a dime down onto the counter. "Your change," he says. 

"I feel like I have," Matt says. "I'm glad you noticed."

"*Your change,*" Leo says, and slides the dime across the counter with his middle finger, pushing it toward Matt.

Matt nods. "I've met a woman," he says. "She runs her own store. THE CLOTHING CLEANING STORE." Matt places the dime in his pocket. 

"Oh yeah," the priest nods. "That place is a shithole. Congrats on the woman though. You know, I've balled a lot of women in the name of the Lord, Matt Lamott." Leo crosses himself and kisses his crucifix. "A lot of women."

<!-- NOTE: I've changed Leo's address to Matt from 'Matthew' to 'Matt Lamott' - mostly to avoid addressing how Matt feels about alternatives to his name. He corrects Laundra earlier, insisting that she call him 'Matt' -->

This comes out of nowhere for Matt. He crinkles his brow in confusion. "I didn't really need to know that but okay. Also, I wanted to tell you that my dad died."

"Sorry to hear that, Son." Leo bites at a fingernail. 

"It's alright. He owned a hotel. I used to live there. A long time ago."

Leo nods and reaches slowly toward the copy of VAGINAS IN THE VATICAN. 

"But I'm gonna get a lot of money, I think. My barber says I just have to go down to the hotel and sort it out," Matt says.

"Mmm hmm," Leo says around a mouthful of coffee-soaked donut. He starts flipping through the porno mag.

"I'm going to be able to build a future," Matt says. He walks toward the door and gives Leo a little wave.

"You take care of yourself," says Father Leo. "And ball that woman good."
