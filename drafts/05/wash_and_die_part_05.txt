Wakes up in a jail cell.
Lala bails him out. says "I own you now."
Matt feels guilty/dirty for sleeping with Lala.
Matt tries to call Laundra.
Laundra is missing. No one has seen her. No one cares.
Lala pushes and pushes Matt to make him fuck her ... to make him choke her. To make him do something. Lala is terribly cruel and kinky and wants to be choked, she wants to be dominated and Matt shies from her, won't take control. Lala is getting bored of his pathetic, filthy face. She pushes Matt too far. He snaps. Once he gets started, he can't stop. Matt kills Lala. He fucks her and/or chokes her. The curtains catch on fire as he squeezes the evil life from her.
Matt stuffs her body into a laundry sack. Drags her out back. Struggles to stuff the sack into the dumpster. It is raining. Lightning flashes. Matt looks up onto the storm. He sees someone walking across the rickety bridge. The wind picks up, howls. The bridge walker slips and falls. Looks down at Matt from far above.

## It's My Potty And I'll Cry If I Want To 

Matt wakes up on the toilet. Wipes the crust from his eyes. Yawns. Instinct moves him to flush. He reaches behind and feels nothing but rough brick wall. He checks the other side. Same. No handle. 

Matt sighs. He sits on a stainless steel bowl bolted to the wall. He looks around for a button. Something that will flush the toilet. He rubs his hands along either side of the bowl. It feels cold and dank and grimy. No button.

Matt stands, hoping to trigger a sensor. Silence. He turns around and looks at the thing. Doesn’t like what he sees. No sensor, no button, no handle. 

Nothing. 

“Shit.”

Matt’s nostrils flare. The toilet needs flushing. He grimaces. Grabs his stomach and sits back down. Here it comes again. He puts his face in his hands and his elbows on his knees. 

Good god. 

PERTURBIN’ BOURBON.

Rough going down. Rough going out.

Much, much later Matt stands up, raw and tired and disgusted. He has all but lost his sense of smell. He shuffles as far away from the toilet as possible, about a few feet. 

The toilet has no lid. It's an open bowl filled with a pile of sin.

Matt presses his face against the bars of his jail cell. The cold is numbing. 

“Hello,” Matt shouts. “Need some assistance!” 

He looks both ways down the barren concrete hallway. 

“Hello?” 

The cement walls throw back the echoes of his cry. 

Matt sighs. He turns around and falls face first on the prison cot. The landing smashes his nose. The cot is rock hard. He winces, curls up and covers his nose with his hands. The pain is sharp.

The pain fades and Matt can feel blood. He checks his hands to be sure. He sits up, pinches his nose and tilts his head back. Matt can taste it. He swallows and closes his eyes. 

Matt's out of toilet paper. 

The sudden fear of being forced to perform sex acts for basic sanitary supplies overcomes him. 

"Help!" 

The faint sound of a toilet flushing can be heard in the distance. 

---

Matt wakes up on the cot. He's stiff as shit. His back aches. Neck is stiff. He tries to turn his head and winces in pain instead. He grunts as he struggles to sit up.
